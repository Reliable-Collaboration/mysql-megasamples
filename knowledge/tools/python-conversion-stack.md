# Facts (verified)
| Package | Version (2026-09-02) | License | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.14.4 on the build host; container image `python:3.13-slim` (**Inferred** availability; 3.13 chosen because pyarrow supports 3.10–3.14 and 3.13 is the most widely packaged) | PSF | runtime |
| `uv` | 0.12.6 on host | Apache-2.0/MIT (**Inferred**, not read) | env + lockfile (`uv.lock` committed) |
| `PyMySQL[rsa]` | 1.2.0 | MIT | client for verify.py and loaders; `[rsa]` extra is required for `caching_sha2_password` ([PyPI](/sources/pypi-pymysql.md)) |
| `duckdb` | see [PyPI duckdb](/sources/pypi-duckdb.md) | MIT | Parquet/CSV normalisation, TPC-H/TPC-DS generators ([DuckDB record](/tools/duckdb.md)) |
| `pyarrow` | 25.0.1 | Apache-2.0 | Parquet footer/schema inspection only (DuckDB does the heavy lifting) |
| `lxml` | 6.1.3 | BSD-3-Clause | Stack Exchange XML (`iterparse`), AdventureWorks XML columns validation |
| `sqlglot` | 30.17.0 | MIT | first-pass DDL/query transpilation T-SQL/Oracle → MySQL for TPC-DS queries and AdventureWorks views; output is always reviewed and tested because "SQLGlot is a transpiler, not a validator" ([PyPI](/sources/pypi-sqlglot.md)) |
| `mwxml` | 0.3.8 (see [mediawiki parsing](/tools/mediawiki-xml-dump-parsing.md)) | MIT | Wikipedia XML |
| `PyYAML` | latest | MIT (**Inferred**, not read) | manifest and test files |

Rejected: `mysql-connector-python` — its software license was not confirmed this session (the manual preface only covers the documentation, [record](/sources/mysql-connector-python-preface.md)); PyMySQL covers every need.

# Limits that matter for this project
* No host installs beyond `uv`-managed virtualenvs (already present); everything else runs in the `loader` image.
* Converters are pure Python + DuckDB; no compiled extensions beyond the wheels above, so arm64 builds work.
