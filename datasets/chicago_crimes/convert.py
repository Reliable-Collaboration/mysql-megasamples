"""Chicago crimes -> MySQL, in two tiers.

  convert.py <downloads> <out.sql>          calendar year 2024 + the IUCR lookup (core)
  convert.py <downloads> <out.sql> --full   2001 through the last closed year, appended (extended)

The full archive arrives as one CSV per year, because a year is ~21 s and ~130 MB that `fetch.py`
can retry, where one request for 8.2 M rows is six minutes of hoping. Those files carry the
`location` column, whose values contain embedded newlines (record hazard 4) -- three physical lines
per row. That is not a problem to route around: DuckDB is a real CSV parser and reads them, and the
column is dropped in the projection because it duplicates latitude and longitude. Asking SODA to
omit it with `$select` instead triples the request time.

The source moves daily, so the snapshot is identified by three things together -- the sha256 in
manifest.yaml, the row count, and `X-SODA2-Truth-Last-Modified` -- rather than by a checksum alone.
The converter records the count it saw so a later fetch that drifts is visible rather than silent.

The City's terms make one paragraph mandatory wherever this data is redistributed; it is written
into the generated SQL and into the table comment, not just into a licence file.
