# The build-time loader image (PLAN.md task P-04, deferred until something actually needed it --
# which is now: SSB has to compile dbgen from source, and TPC-C needs sysbench).
#
# Nothing here reaches the published MySQL image. This container compiles or drives generators and
# writes their output to a mounted directory; it is removed afterwards.
#
# Pinned by digest rather than by tag. On this machine the Docker daemon cannot pull from the
# registry over its own network stack -- the blob CDN answers with a bare EOF, the IPv6 signature
# the runbook puts first -- so the base image is fetched by `scripts/pull_image.py` over IPv4 and
# referenced here by the digest that produced. Container networking itself is fine: apt and git
# both work from inside.
